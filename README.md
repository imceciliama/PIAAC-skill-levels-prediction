# PIAAC-solving-skill-levels-prediction
The PIAAC (–The Programme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies) is a worldwide 
study by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in over 40 countries of 
cognitive and workplace skills. The primary aim of this large-scale survey is to be able to assess 
the skills of literacy, numeracy and problem solving in technology-rich environments, and use 
the collected information to help countries develop ways to further improve these skills. The 
focus is on the working-age population (between the ages of 16 and 65). 

Our study project focuses on the problem-solving in technology-rich environment (PSTRE) 
domain, with the US sample only. When the PSTRE skills were measured in the PIAAC, only 
response data (correctness / incorrectness) were used. However, the process data could give more 
information about adults’ problem-solving strategies, but unfortunately which has not been used 
in previous studies or measurements. Therefore, in this prediction project, we would like to use 
other variables (e.g., process variables, behavioral variables, background variables) to predict the 
adults’ PSTRE level (PS_class: below level 1, level 1, level 2, level 3). The PSTRE level that 
were derived from adults’ responses data only (correctness / incorrectness) will be used as “gold 
standard” in this project. The research question suggests, could we predict the adults’ PSTRE 
skill level using other meaningful variables than the response data only. It would be very 
interesting to know to what degree that we could predict the PSTRE skill levels by variables 
other than response data and identify what kind of variables are the most informative ones. The 
implication of such result will assist educational instructors, researchers, and policy makers 
understand how adults adapt their strategies to solve the digital tasks and what kind of new 
information we should include in measuring adults’ problem-solving skills in future studies. 

Therefore, our task is to use variables in the data file, or create new variables, apply 
supervised machine learning methods, to make a prediction on the problem-solving skill 
levels (PS_class) as accurate as possible.
